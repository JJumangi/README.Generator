# **README Generator Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**

For this assignment:

- I was attempting to create a command-line application that generates a README.md file with a user's input.
- This application utlizes the inquirer package.
- The README file includes a section for the following: license, title, description, installation commands, testing commands, usage, contributing to the repo, questions/contact info, and special thanks.
